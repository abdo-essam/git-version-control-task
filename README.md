# Git Version Control Project

## Project Description
This project demonstrates basic Git version control techniques for a simple web project with two HTML files.

### Features
1. **Track Changes**: Multiple commits to track changes in `index.html` and `about.html`.
2. **Branching**: Organized project versions using Git branches.
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Demonstrated resolving a merge conflict.

### Branching Model
- `main`: Production-ready code.
- `development`: Integration and testing.
- `feature-update`: Feature-specific updates.
- `feature-new-feature`: Future feature implementation.

### Merge Conflict
Conflict resolved in `index.html`. Screenshot attached.
